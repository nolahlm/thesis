Two results of physical interest are the following: (a) superexchange must be expected to show the directional properties (as far as directional relations of interacting magnetic ions are concerned) of the orbitals in the outer shell of the non-magnetic connecting ions; and (b) the sign of the effective exchange integral depends upon the sign of the internal exchange coupling of an added electron on the magnetic ion.},

  abstract = {Complex transition metal oxides have played a central role in the study of magnetic materials, serving as model systems for explorations of fundamental exchange interactions and the relationships between structural, electronic, and magnetic responses. Enabled by advances in epitaxial synthesis techniques, abrupt heterointerfaces and superlattices have emerged as a powerful platform for engineering novel magnetic behavior in oxides. Following a brief introduction to the dominant exchange mechanisms in metal oxides, we review the general means by which interfacial magnetism can be tailored in ABO3 perovskites, including interfacial charge transfer, epitaxial strain and structural coupling, orbital polarizations and reconstructions, and tailoring exchange interactions via cation ordering. Recent examples are provided to illustrate how these strategies have been employed at isolated interfaces and in short-period superlattices. We conclude by briefly discussing underexplored and emerging research directions in the field.},

The intrinsic luminescence at 4.44 eV is due to self-trapped exciton recombination. The intensity of the emitted uv light was measured as a function of the x-ray photon energy from below the calcium K edge to 200 eV above the edge. Dips were observed in the luminescence excitation spectrum corresponding to peaks in the absorption coefficient both in the core excitation region near the edge and in the region of excitation to the continuum far above the edge. The effect is correlated with modulation of the radiative recombination probability of the core hole. The close relationship between the inverse of the luminescence yield and the extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) after background subtraction shows that excitation spectra of uv luminescence can be used to measure EXAFS in thick single crystals and biological samples with suitable luminescence centers.},

  abstract = {Using strain, i.e. subtle changes in lattice constant in a thin film induced by the underlying substrate, opens up intriguing new ways to control material properties. We present a study of the effects of strain on structural and ferromagnetic properties of (1\,1\,1)pc-oriented La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 epitaxial thin films grown on NdGaO3, SrTiO3, and DyScO3 substrates. (The subscript pc denotes the pseudo-cubic symmetry.) The results show that La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 assumes a monoclinic unit cell on NdGaO3 and DyScO3 and a rhombohedral unit cell on SrTiO3. For La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 on NdGaO3 and DyScO3 a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is found, while La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 on SrTiO3 is magnetically isotropic. The Néel model is used to explain the anisotropy of the thin films on NdGaO3 and SrTiO3, however, for La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 on DyScO3 the effect of octahedral rotations needs to be included through the single ion model. Through examination of the Curie temperature of the strained films we suggest that (1\,1\,1)-strain has a different effect on the Jahn–Teller splitting of eg and t2g electron levels than what is seen in (0\,0\,1)pc-oriented La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films.},

Using soft-x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, we established that the Co2+ and Mn4+ ions are ferromagnetically aligned. We also revealed that the Co2+ ions have a large orbital moment: morb/mspin≈0.47. Together with model calculations, this suggests the presence of a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the material and predicts a nontrivial temperature dependence for the magnetic susceptibility.},

In this work, we use high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy to examine the structural and electronic phenomena at the interfaces in two LSCO/LSMO bilayers with reversed growth order. Two different strain mechanisms are at work in these films: compressive or tensile epitaxial strain, and distortion of the octahedral tilt pattern to maintain a network of corner-sharing octahedra. While the epitaxial strain is constant regardless of the growth order, the modification of the octahedral tilt pattern depends on whether the film is grown directly on the substrate or as the second sublayer. As a consequence, exchange spring behavior is observed only when the LSCO sublayer is grown first. The different mechanisms of strain accommodation within the oxygen octahedra network in each material proved to be of critical importance in determining the interfacial structure and thus magnetic and electronic properties of the bilayers.},

The spin polarization of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin films is not intrinsically suppressed at all surfaces and interfaces but is highly sensitive to both the epitaxial strain state as well as the substrate orientation. Through the use of soft x-ray spectroscopy, the magnetic properties of (001)-, (110)-, and (111)-oriented La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 interfaces have been investigated and compared to bulk magnetometry and resistivity measurements. The magnetization of (110)- and (111)-oriented La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 interfaces is more bulk-like as a function of thickness whereas the magnetization at the (001)-oriented La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 interface is suppressed significantly below a layer thickness of 20 nm. Such findings are correlated with the biaxial strain state of the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 films; for a given film thickness it is the tetragonal distortion of (001) La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 that severely impacts the magnetization, whereas the trigonal distortion for (111)-oriented films and monoclinic distortion for (110)-oriented films have less of an impact. These observations provide evidence that surface magnetization and thus spin polarization depend strongly on the crystal surface orientation as well as epitaxial strain.},

  abstract = {FERROELECTRIC materials are characterized by a switchable macroscopic polarization. Most technologically important ferroelectrics are oxides with a perovskite structure. The origin of their ferroelectric behaviour is unclear, however, and there is incomplete understanding of why similar, but chemically different, perovskites should display very different ferroelectric behaviour. The great sensitivity of ferroelectrics to chemistry, defects, electrical boundary conditions and pressure arises from a delicate balance between long-range Coulomb forces (which favour the ferroelectric state) and short-range repulsions (which favour the nonpolar cubic structure). To model the transition accurately, total-energy techniques are required which incorporate the effects of charge distortion and covalency. Here I report results of electronic-structure calculations on two classic examples of ferroelectric perovskites, BaTiO3 and PbTiO3, and demonstrate that hybridization between the titanium 3d states and the oxygen 2p states is essential for ferroelectricity. The different ferroelectric phase behaviour of the two materials is also clear: in PbTiO3, the lead and oxygen states hybridize, leading to a large strain that stabilizes the tetragonal phase, whereas in BaTiO3 the interaction between barium and oxygen is completely ionic, favouring a rhombohedral structure.},

  abstract = {This review presents an overview of the X-ray absorption spectra of 3d transition metals and their compounds. The emphasis is on the description of the X-ray absorption process and the various routes to interpret the results within the framework of their electronic structure. This also includes the use of polarization dependent measurements which are particularly used for the study of the magnetic structure. Emphasis will be given to the metal 2p spectra for which the obtainable resolution has been greatly improved over the last 10 years. The interpretation of 2p core spectra, photoemission as well as absorption, is dominated by short range models, such as the Anderson impurity model. It has been shown that 2p X-ray absorption is relatively insensitive to charge transfer effects which simplifies the analysis. The interpretation with a ligand field multiplet model accounts well for the observed spectra and due to its simplicity this model yields accurate and well defined electronic structure parameters. For the 1s X-ray absorption spectra, of the metals as well as of the ligands, it has been shown that they correspond closely to the unoccupied density of states as determined from single particle schemes using either band structure methods or real space multiple scattering. A number of potentially important effects beyond this interpretation will be discussed. Overviews will be given of the published X-ray absorption results for the metal 2p, the metal 1s and the ligand 1s spectra.},

  abstract = {Transport and magnetic properties of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) manganite thin films and bicrystal junctions were investigated. Epitaxial manganite films were grown on SrTiO3, LaAlO3, NdGaO3 (NGO), and (LaAlO3)0.3\,+\,(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7 substrates, and their magnetic anisotropy were determined by two independent techniques of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that by using these techniques, a small (0.3\%) anisotropy of crystal structure at the (110) surface plane of the orthorhombic NGO substrate leads to uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the films in the plane of the substrate at least at the room temperature. It was found that on vicinal NGO substrates, the value of magnetic anisotropy strength can be varied in the range 100–200\,Oe at T = 295 K by changing the substrate vicinal angle from 0° to 25°. Measurement of the magnetic anisotropy of manganite bicrystal junction demonstrated the presence of two ferromagnetic spin subsystems for both types of bicrystal boundaries with tilting of basal plane of manganite tilted bicrystal (TB-junction) and with rotation of crystallographic axes (RB-junction) used for comparison. The magnetoresistance of TB-junctions increases with decreasing temperature and the misorientation angle. Variation of bicrystal misorientation angle does not lead to change of misorientation of easy magnetic axes in the film parts forming TB-junction. Analysis of the voltage dependencies of bicrystal junction conductivity show that the low value of the magnetoresistance for the LSMO bicrystal junctions can be caused by two scattering mechanisms. The first one is the spin-flip of spin-polarized carriers due to the strong electron-electron interactions in a disordered layer at the bicrystal boundary at low temperatures and the second one is spin-flip by antiferromagnetic magnons at high temperatures.},

It is not only used to investigate single-crystalline materials. This method also enables one to examine electronic ordering phenomena in thin films and to zoom into electronic properties emerging at buried interfaces in artificial heterostructures. During the last 20 years, this technique, which combines x-ray scattering with x-ray absorption spectroscopy, has developed into a powerful probe to study electronic ordering phenomena in complex materials and furthermore delivers important information on the electronic structure of condensed matter. This review provides an introduction to the technique, covers the progress in experimental equipment, and gives a survey on recent RSXS studies of ordering in correlated electron systems and at interfaces.},

We find a striking difference between films grown on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 substrates which appears to stem not only from the difference in epitaxial strain state but also from the level of continuity at the heterointerface. In particular, the chemically and structurally discontinuous LaNiO3/SrTiO3 and LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces cause a large variation in the octahedral network as a function of film thickness whereas the rather continuous LaNiO3/LaAlO3 interface seems to allow from just a few unit cells the formation of a stable octahedral pattern corresponding to that expected only given the applied biaxial strain.},

The total electron yield signal contains contributions from primary, Auger and secondary electrons. We present data on the total electron yield probing depth at core level energies ranging from 77 to 929 eV. By coating materials with chromium overlayers, we find that the maximum probing depth increases with core level energy from 15 to 141 Å. We demonstrate that the Auger electron contribution to total electron yield intensity is negligible, therefore X-ray absorption spectra acquired in X-ray PhotoElectron Emission spectroMicroscopy (X-PEEM) are equivalent to spectra acquired by total electron yield. We find that the signal intensity decreases exponentially with coating thickness, and that total electron yield probing depth and Auger electron range (calculated in the continuously slowing down approximation) are similar at low energies, but diverge for kinetic energies above 400 eV.},

In the system with tensile strain about 0.5\%, a lattice distortion characterized by the modulation vector q=(1/6,1/6,1/6) emerges at 40 K, followed by a ferromagnetic ordering at 24 K. Alternatively, in systems with tensile strain exceeding 1\%, the lattice distortion characterized by q=(1/4,1/4,1/4) emerges at 120 K or higher, and subsequently the ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic ordering occurs around 90 K. The evolution of infrared phonon spectra and resonant x-ray scattering at the Co K edge suggests that the population change in the Co 3d spin state causes the strain-induced switching of spin-state ordering as well as of magnetic ordering in this canonical spin-state crossover system.},

That is, only superlattices in which the LaNiO3 layers are metallic exhibit ferromagnetism. Using several magnetic probes, we have determined that the ferromagnetism arises in a single unit cell of CaMnO3 at the interface. Together these results suggest that ferromagnetism can be attributed to a double exchange interaction among Mn ions mediated by the adjacent itinerant metal.},

This system exhibits magnetic and electronic segregation within the LSCO layer characterized by soft FM Co2+ ions at the interface (s-LSCO), which is biased by the underlying hard LSCO layer (h-LSCO), characterized by predominantly Co3+/Co4+ FM ions. For a 5.1-nm layer, the interfacial Co2+ ion concentration is maximized and the h-LSCO coercivity is minimized, while the opposite is true for a 7.8-nm LSCO layer. These dual trends in Co2+ ion concentration and h-LSCO coercivity within the LSCO serve to independently affect the exchange bias and coercivity of the soft FM layer, resulting in inverse trends between these properties that typically vary simultaneously.},

X-ray magnetic circular dichroism indicates that the remanent magnetic state of thick LSMO films is opposite to the direction of the applied magnetic field. Spectroscopic and scattering measurements reveal that the average Mn valence varies from mixed Mn3+/Mn4+ to an enriched Mn3+ region near the STO interface, resulting in a compressive lattice along the a, b axis and a possible electronic reconstruction in the Mn eg orbital (d3z2−r2). This reconstruction may provide a mechanism for coupling the Mn3+ moments antiferromagnetically along the surface normal direction, and in turn may lead to the observed reversed magnetic configuration.},

  abstract = {With a Curie point at 370 K, the half-metal (La0.7Sr0.3)MnO3 (LSMO) is one of the most interesting candidates for electronic devices based on tunnel magnetoresistance. SrTiO3 (STO) is up to now the best substrate for the epitaxy of suitable thin films of LSMO. The pseudocubic unit cell of rhombohedral LSMO has a parameter a LSMO such that (a STO − a LSMO)/a LSMO = + 0.83\% (where a STO is the parameter of cubic STO) and an angle of 90.26°. As strained growth is tetragonal, relaxation implies recovery of both the pseudocubic parameter and of the original angle. In the LSMO layers that we prepare by pulsed-laser deposition, we show that these two processes are quite independent. The angular distortion is partially recovered by twinning in films 25 nm thick, while recovery of the parameter never occurs in the thickness range that we explored (up to 432 nm). A relaxation, however, takes place above a thickness of 100 nm, associated with a transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional columnar growth. It is accompanied by chemical fluctuations. Our magnetic measurements exhibit Curie temperatures and magnetic moments very close to the bulk values in those layers where the crystal parameter is strained but the angle partially relaxed.},

The spin-state structure for these compounds was studied by soft x-ray magnetic circular dichroism and by near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure at the Co L2,3 and O K edges. It turns out that superexchange between Co3+ high-spin and Co3+ low-spin states is responsible for the ferromagnetism in LaCoO3. For La0.7Ce0.3CoO3 the Co3+ ions are in a low-spin state and the spin and orbital moments are predominantly determined by a Co2+ high-spin configuration. A spin blockade naturally explains the low transition temperature and the insulating characteristics of La0.7Ce0.3CoO3. For La0.7Sr0.3CoO3, on the other hand, the magnetic moments in the epitaxial films originate from high-spin Co3+ and high-spin Co4+ states. Ferromagnetism is induced by t2g double exchange between the two high-spin configurations. For all systems, a strong magnetic anisotropy is observed, with the magnetic moments essentially oriented within the film plane.},

Epitaxial pulsed laser deposited La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3(001) thin films in the range from 3 unit cell (uc) to 40 uc (1.2–16 nm) have been investigated through ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry at variable temperature. Magnetodynamically, three different thickness, d, regimes are identified: 20 uc ≲d uc where the system is bulk like, a transition region 8 uc r d≲20 uc where the FMR linewidth and the position depend on thickness and d ¼6 uc which displays significantly altered magnetodynamic properties, while still displaying bulk magnetization. Magnetization and FMR measurements are consistent with a nonmagnetic volume corresponding to \$ 4 uc. We observe a reduction of Curie temperature (TC) with decreasing thickness, which is coherent with a mean field model description. The reduced ordering temperature also accounts for the thickness dependence of the magnetic anisotropy constants and resonance fields. The damping of the system is strongly thickness dependent, and is for thin films dominated by thickness dependent anisotropies, yielding both a strong two-magnon scattering close to Tc and a low temperature broadening. For the bulk like samples a large part of the broadening can be linked to spread in magnetic anisotropies attributed to crystal imperfections/domain boundaries of the bulk like film.},

One of the main advantages perovskites have is their ability to be processed from solutions at relatively low temperatures. This paper briefly describes main structural, optical and electrical properties of perovskite materials, as well as the most popular solution processing techniques. We reflect on current progress in fabrication of solar cells containing organic–inorganic perovskites, device inner workings and effect of cell architecture on efficiency, along with prospective fine tuning of device properties through alteration of organometallic halide structure. Over the span of only three years, reported photoconversion efficiencies of such devices went from 3.8\% to over 19\%, with further increase being expected in near future. Finally, we describe other prospective applications for different perovskite materials. There is no doubt that perovskite photovoltaics possess great potential to provide bright future for the field of solar cells research, but whether they are going to live up to their expectations, remains to be seen.},

  abstract = {Charge ordering occurs in some mixed-valent transition metal oxides. The perovskite manganates of the formula Ln1-xAxMnO3 (Ln = rare earth; A = Ca, Sr) are especially interesting because long-range ordering of the Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions in these materials is linked to antiferromagnetic spin ordering, and also to the long-range ordering of the Mn3+ (eg) orbitals and the associated lattice distortions. Charge ordering occurs at a higher temperature than spin ordering in some of the manganates (TCO {$>$} TN), whereas in some others TCO = TN. Orbital ordering occurs without charge ordering in the A-type antiferromagnetic manganates, but in the manganates where charge ordering occurs, antiferromagnetism of CE-type is found along with orbital ordering. The subtle relations between charge, spin, and orbital ordering are discussed in the article, with special attention to the effects of cation size, chemical substitution, dimensionality, pressure, and magnetic and electric fields. Unusual features such as phase separation and electron−hole asymmetry are also examined.},

  abstract = {Research in ABO3 perovskite oxides ranges from fundamental scientific studies in superconductivity and magnetism to technologies for advanced low-power electronics, energy storage, and conversion. The breadth in functionalities observed in this versatile materials class originates, in part, from the ability to control the local and extended crystallographic structure of corner-connected octahedral units. While an established paradigm exists to alter the size, shape, and connectivity of the octahedral building blocks in bulk materials, these approaches are often limited to certain subsets of the allowed perovskite archetypes and chemistries. In this article, we describe emerging routes in thin films and multilayer superlattices enabled by epitaxial synthesis aimed at engineering the octahedral connectivity—rotational magnitudes and patterns—to reach unexplored portions of the crystallographic structure–property phase space for rational materials design. We review three promising chemistry-independent strategies that provide a handle to tune the octahedral connectivity: epitaxial strain, interfacial control at perovskite/perovskite heterojunctions, and rotation engineering in short-period superlattices. Finally, we touch upon potential new functionalities that could be attained by extending these approaches to static and dynamic manipulation of the perovskite structure through external fields and highlight unresolved questions for the deterministic control of octahedral rotations in perovskite-structured materials.},

This influences a long-range ferromagnetic ordering, showing a finite Tc up to 50\% Mn doping at the Ru site. A crystal-field-multiplet calculation indicates that the intensity distribution of the t2g- and eg-related peaks between the Ru L2 and Ru L3 edges reflects the Ru valences, rather than the crystal field interactions. By comparison with the Mn L2,3 x-ray absorption spectroscopy of the well-known Mn(III) and Mn(IV) references, the mixed-valence Mn ions in the SrRu1−xMnxO3 system are confirmed. This study forms a basis for the understanding of exchange interactions between two dissimilar transition-metal ions in the manganite crystal lattice.},

Theoretical consideration of these additional carriers shows that they cause a local enhancement of ferromagnetic double exchange with respect to AFM superexchange, resulting in local canting of the AFM spins. This leads to a highly modulated magnetization, as measured by polarized neutron reflectometry. The spatial modulation of the canting is related to the spreading of charge from the doped layer and establishes a fundamental length scale for charge transfer, transformation of orbital occupancy, and magnetic order in these manganites. Furthermore, we confirm the existence of the canted, AFM state as was predicted by de Gennes [Phys. Rev. 118, 141 (1960)] but had remained elusive.},

Under such strains, the properties of oxides can be dramatically altered. In this article, we review the use of elastic strain to enhance ferroics, materials containing domains that can be moved through the application of an electric field (ferroelectric), a magnetic field (ferromagnetic), or stress (ferroelastic). We describe examples of transmuting oxides that are neither ferroelectric nor ferromagnetic in their unstrained state into ferroelectrics, ferromagnets, or materials that are both at the same time (multiferroics). Elastic strain can also be used to enhance the properties of known ferroic oxides or to create new tunable microwave dielectrics with performance that rivals that of existing materials. Results show that for thin films of ferroic oxides, elastic strain is a viable alternative to the traditional method of chemical substitution to lower the energy of a desired ground state relative to that of competing ground states to create materials with superior properties.},

Revisions are based on new structural data, empirical bond strength-bond length relationships, and plots of (1) radii vs volume, (2) radii vs coordination number, and (3) radii vs oxidation state. Factors which affect radii additivity are polyhedral distortion, partial occupancy of cation sites, covalence, and metallic character. Mean Nb5+-O and Mo6+-O octahedral distances are linearly dependent on distortion. A decrease in cation occupancy increases mean Li+-O, Na+-O, and Ag+-O distances in a predictable manner. Covalence strongly shortens Fe2+-X, Co2+-X, Ni2+-X, Mn2+-X, Cu+-X, Ag+-X, and M-H- bonds as the electronegativity of X or M decreases. Smaller effects are seen for Zn2+-X, Cd2+-X, In2+-X, pb2+-X, and TI+-X. Bonds with delocalized electrons and therefore metallic character, e.g. Sm-S, V-S, and Re-O, are significantly shorter than similar bonds with localized electrons.},

We have studied the thickness-dependent MIT of the ferromagnetic metal La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 by x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism. As the film thickness was decreased across the critical thickness of the MIT (6–8 ML), a gradual decrease of the ferromagnetic signals and a concomitant increase of paramagnetic signals were observed, while the Mn valence abruptly decreased towards Mn3+. These observations suggest that the ferromagnetic phase gradually and most likely inhomogeneously turns into the paramagnetic phase and both phases abruptly become insulating at the critical thickness.},

  abstract = {Octahedral tilts are the most ubiquitous distortions in perovskite-related structures that can dramatically influence ferroelectric, magnetic, and electronic properties; yet the paradigm of tilt epitaxy in thin films is barely explored. Non-destructively characterizing such epitaxy in three-dimensions for low symmetry complex tilt systems composed of light anions is a formidable challenge. Here we demonstrate that the interfacial tilt epitaxy can transform ultrathin calcium titanate, a non-polar earth-abundant mineral, into high-temperature polar oxides that last above 900\,K. The comprehensive picture of octahedral tilts and polar distortions is revealed by reconstructing the three-dimensional electron density maps across film-substrate interfaces with atomic resolution using coherent Bragg rod analysis. The results are complemented with aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, film superstructure reflections, and are in excellent agreement with density functional theory. The study could serve as a broader template for non-destructive, three-dimensional atomic resolution probing of complex low symmetry functional interfaces., In complex oxides, oxygen octahedra are major structural motifs and their tilts sensitively determine the material’s physical properties. Exploiting Coherent Bragg Rod Analysis enables 3D mapping of complex tilt patterns and reveals the means to control polarization through them in CaTiO3 thin films.},

  abstract = {ZnO thin films were grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) at different substrate temperature ranging from 200 to 700°C. X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscope (AFM), photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy are applied to investigate the change of properties. The results suggest that Raman scattering is the more effective technique to reveal the crystal quality of ZnO thin films compared with XRD and PL spectrum. The intensity of the UV emission peaks and XRD spectrum suggest no much dependence on the crystal quality. The higher temperature of the substrate, the easier of the defects will be formed during the deposition, and optimum temperature is 400°C in this letter.},
